### Description
In this project, made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Written code to import the data and answer interesting questions, by computing descriptive statistics. Also written a python script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Project overview:
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Files used
The files (data) used to explore the project and also included in the execution of the python scripts are:
 * [chicago.csv](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)
 * [new_york_city.csv](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
 * [washington.csv](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)

### The Dataset:
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year

### Statistics Computed:
Analyzed the data related to bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, written code to provide the following information:

##### 1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time):
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

##### 2. Popular stations and trip:
* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

##### 3. Trip duration:
* total travel time
* average travel time

##### 4. User info:
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Technologies Used:
+ **Python**
    > Used Python programming language to explore data related to bikeshare.

+ **Numpy and Pandas**
    > Used to explore and manipulate DataFrames and performed statistical analysis.

+ **Visual Studio Code**
    > Used to make exploratory analysis and write appropriate SQL queries to answer the posed questions.

+ **Git Version Control**
    > Used to control and record the project files. Shared the work on GitHub profile.

## Software requirements:
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:
* You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
