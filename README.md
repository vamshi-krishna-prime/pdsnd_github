### Description
In this project, made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Written code to import the data and answer interesting questions, by computing descriptive statistics. Also written a python script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
The files (data) used to explore the project and also included in the execution of the python scripts are:
 * [chicago.csv](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)
